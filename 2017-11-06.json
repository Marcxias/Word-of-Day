    "background": "Parable comes to us via Anglo-French from the Late Latin word parabola, which in turn comes from Greek parabolē, meaning \"comparison.\" The word parabola may look familiar if you remember your geometry. The mathematical parabola refers to a kind of comparison between a fixed point and a straight line, resulting in a parabolic curve; it came to English from New Latin (Latin as used since the end of the medieval period, especially in scientific description and classification). Parable, however, descends from Late Latin (the Latin language used by writers in the 3rd to 6th centuries). The Late Latin term parabola referred to verbal comparisons: it essentially meant \"allegory\" or \"speech.\" Other English descendants of Late Latin parabola are parole and palaver.",
