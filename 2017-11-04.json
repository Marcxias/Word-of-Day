    "background": "Stridulate is one member of a word family that has its ancestry in the Latin word stridulus, meaning \"shrill.\" The word alludes to the sharp, high-pitched sound that is produced by a number of insects—particularly crickets and grasshoppers but also certain beetles—as well as other animals, usually as a mating call or a signal of territorial behavior. Stridulus comes from stridere, which is the direct source of our noun stridor, a word found in medical dictionaries. Stridor means \"a harsh, shrill, or creaking noise\" and also \"a harsh vibrating sound heard during respiration in cases of obstruction of the air passages.\"",
