    "example": [
        "The Greek word pathos means \"suffering,\" \"experience,\" or \"emotion.\" It was borrowed into English in the 16th century, and for English speakers, the term usually refers to the emotions produced by tragedy or a depiction of tragedy. Pathos has quite a few kin in English. Pathetic is used to describe things that move us to pity. Empathy is the ability to feel the emotions of another. Though pathology is not literally \"the study of suffering,\" it is \"the study of diseases.\" You can probably guess at more relatives of pathos. Sympathy, apathy, antipathy, sociopath, and psychopath are a few."
