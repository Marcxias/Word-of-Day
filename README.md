> Collect these words as if I will learn it.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Caulidata/Word-of-Day.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Caulidata/Word-of-Day)

This README is also available in [简体中文](https://github.com/Caulidata/Word-of-Day/blob/master/README-zh_CN.md)

**All the JSON files are placed under the [Resources](https://github.com/Caulidata/Word-of-Day/tree/resources) branch.**

## Feature

This project runs every day and dumps the [word of day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day) on [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com) into a single JSON file, then push to the resources branch of this repo.

## License

Since I didn't find the exact license for the 'word of day' section (including the podcast), you should contact Merriam-Webster if you are going to use the these data in your project. The JSON data in this repo should only be used for academic purpose.
